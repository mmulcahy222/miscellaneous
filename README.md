# Miscellaneous

I am new at Git & GitHub, so I faced the decision if I should put everything in many repositories, or one repository. I saw this article here called "Mono-repo or multi-repo? Why choose one, when you can have both?" and I agreed https://medium.com/@patrickleet/mono-repo-or-multi-repo-why-choose-one-when-you-can-have-both-e9c77bd0c668. This is the "mono-repo" of the smaller scripts which I deemed not worthy enough to have it's own repository. Just tried for the best of both worlds & approaches. 

# Image Reduce

I made this to reduce the size of the images in my hard drive, and was able to save about 200 GB in hard disk drive space. It is DYNAMIC. With the magic of Python, it changes the quality based on the size of the file size. Larger files will get reduced & compressed heavily, small ones will not be compressed as much. Love this nifty tool I made. 

# Save Hard Drive

This is a very quick way to back up computer files into external hard drives. It only uses a program made already called "xcopy" with it's parameters. The one difference between here is that I could put ALL the directories I want inside of a Python List structure and it will just back up based on that. It is flexible enough to back up different directories based on the hard drive I'm using. I'm pleased with it.

# Date Renamer

Python program that heavily uses CTypes & Microsoft Windows API functions. Windows API is very challenging to say the least, but it's something I've always wanted to do since I was a kid and appealed to my geeky curious side, in spite of it's poor coding practices in the 1980's & weird function calls. I wanted to challenge myself doing something relatively hard with WinAPI for my operating system education (using Python + CTypes), you could see more WinAPI work of mine with the State Design Pattern Repository in my account.

Since I record a lot of video in multiple phones & tablets, I needed a way to arrange the dates for my video Editing Software. What this does is put the date it was recorded in the beginning of the filename, so the videos are in order for the video editing software when I dump them in there.

I love Windows API work & functions!
